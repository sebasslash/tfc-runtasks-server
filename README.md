# TFC Run Tasks Server

Run Tasks are a beta feature of Terraform Cloud (TFC) that allow you to add new functionality to your Terraform Cloud run lifecycle.

This is a simple webserver that exposes a few endpoints that can be used to test different possible Run Task outcomes without integrating your own solution.
